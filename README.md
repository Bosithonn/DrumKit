# DrumKit
A drum kit (also called a drum set,[a] 
trap set, or simply drums) is a collection of drums, cymbals
, and other auxiliary percussion instruments set up to be played by one person.
[1] The player (drummer) typically holds a pair of matching drumsticks,
one in each hand, and uses their feet to operate a foot-controlled hi-hat and bass drum pedal.
